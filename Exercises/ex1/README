Assignment 1:
============================================
=        mkdir("Welcome", 0775) = 0        =
============================================
Successfully created a folder named "Welcome" (return value 0)

============================================
=       mkdir("Welcome/To", 0775) = 0      =
============================================
Successfully create a folder within "Welcome" named "To".
0775 This is the file permission

=================================================================================
=   openat(AT_FDCWD, "Welcome/To/OS2021", O_WRONLY|O_CREAT|O_TRUNC, 0666) = 3   =
=================================================================================
System call that open file named OS2021*** for writing (O_WRONLY) in folder "Welcome/To"
(in this case, since we just created the folder it will create a new one (O_CREAT))
and cuts the file to be of length 0 (O_TRUNC).
When there is a failure it returns -1 so here it is successful (returned 3).

==============================================================
=    fstat(3, {st_mode=S_IFREG|0644, st_size=0, ...}) = 0    =
==============================================================
A system call that returns information about the file OS2021.
returns 0 upon success so here it is successful.

===================================================================
=    write(3, "yair.shtern\nIf you haven't read "..., 80) = 80    =
===================================================================
Write to the file 80 characters (seems to be some of the course guidelines...)
and returns 80 - which means success
(returns -1 when failed).

====================
=   close(3) = 0   =
====================
closing the file successfully (return 0)

=========================================
=    unlink("Welcome/To/OS2021") = 0    =
=========================================
Successfully deletes the OS2021 file (returns 0)

==================================
=    rmdir("Welcome/To/") = 0    =
