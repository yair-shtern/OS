q1:
One use of Linux pid namespaces is creating isolation
between processes within the container and processes outside of it.
Each PID name space is unaware of processes outside its
PID name space, with the exception of its descendant PID name spaces.

q2:
Linux mount namespaces allow us to isolate processes mount view within each
name space instance, such that all the processes in the same name space
have the same view and such that changes in the mount tree of one mount
name space instance will not effect another name space instance.

q3:
Limiting the CPU usage time of processes under specific cgroup instance.

q4:
Clone command is used for starting a new process in a way similar to
fork, only that by using clone we have more control over setting the
process environment and limitations.

q5:
Chroot command changes the root directory of a specific process or group
of processes.

q6:
The proc file system is pseudo-file system which provides an hierarchical
file like interface into the kernel data structures. It allows the user
to access kernel data about current processes and threads in a way
that's comfortable and intuitive.
