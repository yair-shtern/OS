Question 1:
When we want to have control over the scheduling order of some processes,
we can use user-level threads,
in which the OS is unaware of the multiple processes inside the thread and
thus the scheduler won't
control their order.

Question 2:
The most obvious advantage is security such that if one each process has its own PCB.
A disadvantage would be the costly overhead that each process context switching has.

Question 3:
When we type "kill pid" into the shell it triggers
the OS to send a SIGTERM signal (which is the default signal)
to the process that in turn, terminates the process.

Question 4:
Real time measures the time that passes including various interrupts or I/O
delays that may happen. Virtual time on the other hand measures the actual time the
CPU requires to complete a job, without the interrupts.

Question 5:
- sigsetjmp: saves the state of the current process in the exact moment that
sigsetjmp was called, the state includes the whole environment of the running process.
- siglongjmp: Jumps back into the saved environment of some process that was set
by sigsetjmp.
